# Developer Code Examples

This folder provides a sandbox of code snippets and jupyter
notebooks used by developers to better understand the core
libraries that tsdat utilizes (namely **xarray** and
 **ACT**, but also **numpy** and **pandas**).
 
These examples are intended for tsdat developer use only, and may
be moved into a separate repository at a later date.  **Use the
examples folder for complete, annotated examples of using the 
tsdat pipeline library.**

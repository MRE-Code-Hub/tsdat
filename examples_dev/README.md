# Developer Code Examples

This folder contains annotated, interactive Jupyter Notebook examples
used for better understanding the core libraries that tsdat
will work with.  Namely **xarray** and **ACT**, but it may
also include numpy and pandas examples as well.  In addition
we may add notebooks for working with specific data formats.

These examples are intended for tsdat developer use only, and may
be moved into a separate repository at a later date.

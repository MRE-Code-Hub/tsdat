Pipelines
#########

Pipelines provide ways of automating data processing, standardization, and plotting.



Ingest Pipeline
---------------

Tsdat currently only offers one pipeline out-of-the-box; the IngestPipeline. The IngestPipeline class provides a 
framework for processing raw instrument data and applying sets of corrections, quality controls, and other custom 
functions to the data. The IngestPipeline also uses a configuration file to add metadata to the produced dataset(s),
resulting in higher-quality standardized data that can be used as the basis for further scientific analysis.

More information on the Ingest Pipeline and the Pipeline base class coming soon...


Pipeline Configurations
-----------------------

Configuration files provide an explict way to define and customize the behavior of tsdat processing pipelines. This
section describes configuration files at a high level and provides references to examples and templates that can be
used to set up configuration files.


Coming soon...

Examples and Tutorials
######################

We understand that many people learn better from examples than large walls of 
text and API references. That is why we have collected a set of examples and 
tutorials that we think are helpful for explaining how tsdat can be used to 
simplify the development of develop data pipelines and to show off some of the
more advanced features of the library.


Examples
********

Tsdat hosts several examples on its GitHub repository at 
https://github.com/tsdat/tsdat/tree/master/examples/. 

More examples coming soon.

Tutorials
*********

We are starting to develop and collect written and video tutorials that provide
walkthroughs of common tsdat workflows. See below for a list of tutorials:

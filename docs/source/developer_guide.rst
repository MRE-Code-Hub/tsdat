tsdat is an open-source project that is still in its infancy. We 
enthusiastically welcome any feedback in the form of `Issues`_ or `Pull 
requests`_ that helps us track down bugs, identify new areas or features that 
we can expand into or develop, or ideas on how this library can be improved for
efficiency, new use cases, or in any other aspect.
